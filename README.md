# 🌐 Online Charity & Donation Management System

This is a web-based donation management platform developed as a DBMS project. It connects **donors**, **volunteers**, **foundations**, and **individuals in need** to create a transparent, trackable, and trustworthy donation ecosystem.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Enables **volunteers** to register individuals who lack access to devices or the internet
- Supports **foundations and individuals** in creating donation requests and posting regular updates
- Verifies volunteers through **documents (SSC certificate, income, guardian info)**
- Tracks every donation with **monthly proof uploads** (photos, receipts)
- Provides a **geo-targeted search** (division/district/disaster zone filtering)
- Includes **admin-triggered emergency campaigns** (e.g., floods, winter relief)
- Implements **fraud detection** using simple logic (duplicate profiles, missing proof, low-rated volunteers)
- Accepts donations via **Bkash and bank transfer**, logged for transparency
- Supports **ratings and reviews** for volunteers, enabling bonus incentives

## 💻 Technologies Used
