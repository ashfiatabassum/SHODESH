🔹 What is Concurrent Execution?

Concurrent execution means multiple transactions are allowed to run at the same time in the database system, rather than one after another (serial execution).

Example:

Transaction T1 is reading data from disk.

Transaction T2 can simultaneously use the CPU for some computation.

🔹 Why Run Transactions Concurrently?
1. Increased Resource Utilization

CPU, memory, and disk are used more efficiently.

While one transaction waits for disk I/O, another can use the CPU.

Result: Higher throughput (more transactions completed per unit time).

Example:

T1 reads a large file (CPU idle while waiting).

T2 calculates something in memory (CPU active).

2. Reduced Average Response Time

Short transactions don’t have to wait for long transactions to finish.

This reduces waiting time for transactions that are quick to complete.

Example:

T1 is a long bank transfer.

T2 is a quick balance check.

With concurrency, T2 can finish while T1 is still processing.

🔹 Problem with Concurrent Execution

If multiple transactions access the same data at the same time, it may destroy database consistency.

Example:

T1 is transferring money from A to B.

T2 reads the balance of A before T1 finishes.

T2 might get wrong data, leading to inconsistent results.

🔹 Solution: Concurrency Control

Concurrency control schemes are mechanisms to ensure isolation among transactions.

They control interactions among concurrent transactions so that the database remains consistent.

Types include locking, timestamp ordering, and optimistic methods (details usually in later chapters).

Goal: Make concurrent execution correct, meaning the final state is as if transactions ran one after another (serially).

✅ In short:

Concurrent execution improves performance and response time.

But it can create conflicts between transactions.

Concurrency control ensures that concurrent transactions don’t violate consistency.

If you want, I can also draw a simple diagram showing two transactions running concurrently and how concurrency control prevents conflicts — it makes it much easier to visualize.
